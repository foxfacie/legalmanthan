🔹 Introduction
One of the recurring questions in Hindu Matrimonial Law is whether a wife can claim maintenance or property rights from her in-laws when the husband is unable or unwilling to provide support. This issue brings into play provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, and the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.
This article explains the legal principles with the help of leading judicial precedents.
________________________________________
🔹 Maintenance: Liability of Husband vs. In-Laws
•	The primary obligation to maintain a wife lies on the husband (Section 125 CrPC).
•	In-laws are generally not liable unless the property is joint family property and the husband has no separate income.
📌 Case Law:
•	Kirtikant D. Vadodaria v. State of Gujarat, (1996) 4 SCC 479 – The Supreme Court held that a daughter-in-law cannot claim maintenance from her father-in-law if the property is self-acquired and the husband is alive.
•	Vimlaben Ajitbhai Patel v. Vatslaben Ashokbhai Patel, (2008) 4 SCC 649 – The Court clarified that liability of in-laws arises only in respect of coparcenary/joint family property, not self-acquired property.

🔹 Right to Residence under DV Act, 2005
A wife has the right to reside in the “shared household” under Section 17 of the DV Act, regardless of her ownership rights.
📌 Case Law:
•	S.R. Batra v. Taruna Batra, (2007) 3 SCC 169 – The Supreme Court held that the wife has no right to live in a house owned exclusively by her in-laws; “shared household” means the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband, or the house where the husband has a share.
•	Satish Chander Ahuja v. Sneha Ahuja, (2020) 11 SCC 415 – The Supreme Court overruled Taruna Batra to an extent, holding that a “shared household” is not restricted to property owned/rented by the husband; if the wife lived there in a domestic relationship, she has residence rights.

🔹 Nature of Property: Ancestral vs. Self-Acquired
•	Ancestral property: Wife and children can claim rights through the husband’s share.
•	Self-acquired property of father-in-law: Neither the wife nor the children have any birthright during his lifetime.
📌 Case Law:
•	Arunachala Gounder (Dead) v. Ponnusamy, (2022) 11 SCC 118 – The Supreme Court reiterated that self-acquired property of a Hindu devolves absolutely to his heirs as per succession law; no one can claim a right during his lifetime.
•	Prakash v. Phulavati, (2016) 2 SCC 36 – Daughters have equal rights in ancestral/coparcenary property by birth (post-2005 amendment to Section 6 HSA).
________________________________________
🔹 Succession Rights of Children
•	If the father-in-law dies intestate, his property devolves equally among his widow, sons, and daughters (Class I heirs under Section 8 HSA).
•	The wife and children can then indirectly secure rights through the husband’s share.
📌 Case Law:
•	Commissioner of Wealth Tax v. Chander Sen, (1986) 3 SCC 567 – Clarified distinction between ancestral property and property inherited by a son from his father (which becomes his absolute property under Section 8).
•	Vineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma, (2020) 9 SCC 1 – Reaffirmed that daughters are coparceners by birth and enjoy equal rights in ancestral property.
________________________________________
🔹 Transfer of Property by Mother-in-Law
•	If the mother-in-law is absolute owner (via will or inheritance), she can transfer property to anyone, including daughters.
•	If other heirs (sons, daughters) also have a share, unilateral transfer can be challenged in civil court by filing a partition suit or injunction.
📌 Case Law:
•	Gurupad v. Hirabai, (1978) 3 SCC 383 – Supreme Court explained succession rights of Class I heirs under the Hindu Succession Act.
________________________________________
🔹 Conclusion
From the above discussion:
1.	Wife’s maintenance lies against husband, not directly against in-laws (Kirtikant Vadodaria).
2.	Wife’s right to residence exists in a “shared household” (Sneha Ahuja), but not as ownership.
3.	Children and wife have no rights in father-in-law’s self-acquired property during his lifetime (Arunachala Gounder).
4.	On intestate death of father-in-law, property devolves to widow, sons, and daughters equally; the wife can then claim through her husband’s share.
5.	A mother-in-law, being the absolute owner, can legally transfer property, unless it is jointly owned by all heirs.
Thus, a Hindu wife cannot claim direct ownership in in-laws’ property, but she can secure maintenance, residence, and inheritance rights depending on the nature of property and succession.
