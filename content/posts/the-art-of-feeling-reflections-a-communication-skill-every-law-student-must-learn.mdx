When we think of lawyering, we often imagine arguments, statutes, and courtroom battles. But one of the most underrated skills for any lawyer—especially in fields like family law—is listening and responding to client emotions with empathy. This is where the art of feeling reflections comes in.

What Are Feeling Reflections?

Feeling reflections are a way of responding to clients’ emotions in a way that shows you have truly heard and understood them. Instead of focusing only on the facts, you acknowledge the client’s emotional state—whether it is anger, fear, anxiety, or frustration.
For example:
A client slams the desk and says, “My husband betrayed me!”
•	Weak reflection: “You seem a little upset.”
•	Accurate reflection: “You’re really angry about what he did.”
The second response is far more effective because it captures the intensity of the emotion without minimizing it.
Why Accuracy Matters
Minimizing emotions with phrases like “a little bit,” “sort of,” or “kind of” can make clients feel unheard. Inaccurate reflections may damage trust and rapport. On the other hand, even if you don’t reflect the exact feeling (confusing frustration with anger, for instance), clients usually appreciate the effort to understand them.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Law students and young lawyers often fall into these traps:
1.	Judgmental responses – e.g., “It’s good you’re angry at him.” This makes clients feel judged and may stop them from sharing openly.
2.	Reassurances – e.g., “Don’t worry, you’ll get over it.” This minimizes their feelings and suggests their emotions are unimportant.
3.	Overused starter phrases – e.g., “I can understand how you feel.” Clients may find such statements hollow or patronizing.
The Right Way to Reflect Feelings
The goal is simple: be empathetic, neutral, and direct. Use short reflective statements like:
•	“You’re angry.”
•	“You feel anxious.”
•	“You’re frustrated.”
Building a richer emotional vocabulary also helps. Words like hurt, vulnerable, disappointed, abandoned, anxious, betrayed, and helpless can go a long way in accurately reflecting what clients are going through.

Why It Matters for Law Students

As future lawyers, learning to reflect feelings accurately will set you apart. It strengthens rapport, encourages clients to share openly, and avoids unnecessary misunderstandings. More importantly, it reminds us that law is not just about rules—it’s about people.

✅ Takeaway: Feeling reflections may seem awkward at first, but with practice, they become one of the most powerful tools for client communication. Mastering this skill early in your legal journey will make you not just a better listener, but also a more effective and empathetic lawyer.
