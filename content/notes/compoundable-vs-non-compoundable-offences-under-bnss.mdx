## 1. Compoundable Offences
These are offences where the complainant can voluntarily withdraw the case and reach a compromise with the accused.

- Whether court permission is required depends on the nature of the offence.  
- **Examples:** Minor assault, simple hurt, defamation.  

---

## 2. Non-Compoundable Offences
These are offences where compromise is not legally permissible, even if both parties are willing.

- The court must proceed with the trial since such offences affect the interest of society at large.  
- **Examples:** Murder, rape, dacoity.

## BNSS Updates
