# Mortgage under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882

Mortgage is governed by **Sections 58 to 104** of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (TPA). These provisions lay down the rules, rights, and liabilities of mortgagors and mortgagees.

2. **Mortgage by Conditional Sale** – Property is ostensibly sold with a condition of retransfer on repayment.  
3. **Usufructuary Mortgage** – Possession is transferred to the mortgagee, who uses rents and profits in lieu of repayment.  
4. **English Mortgage** – Mortgagor transfers property absolutely, subject to retransfer on repayment by a fixed date.  
5. **Mortgage by Deposit of Title Deeds** – Debt is secured by depositing title deeds with a creditor (common with banks).
