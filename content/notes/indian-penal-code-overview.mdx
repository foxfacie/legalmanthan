# Indian Penal Code: Comprehensive Overview and Key Provisions

The Indian Penal Code (IPC), enacted in 1860, serves as the primary criminal code in India. This comprehensive legislation defines crimes and prescribes punishments, forming the backbone of India's criminal justice system.

## Historical Background

### Colonial Origins
The IPC was drafted by the First Law Commission of India under the chairmanship of Lord Macaulay. It came into force on January 1, 1862, and was based on the principles of:

- **Clarity and Simplicity**: Easy to understand and apply
- **Uniformity**: Consistent application across British India
- **Comprehensiveness**: Covering all major criminal offenses

### Modern Relevance
Despite being over 160 years old, the IPC remains largely relevant, though it has been amended numerous times to address contemporary issues.

## Structure of the Indian Penal Code

The IPC is organized into 23 chapters containing 511 sections:
